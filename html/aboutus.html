It has also been recommended by CCTV's "Taste of Hometown" and <br> Tianjin Satellite TV's "Entrepreneurial Chinese" and is deeply favored            by the Chinese

In 2020, Wumingyuan will enter the four major overseas markets of Europe, the United States, Asia, and Oceania, launch a globalization strategy, spread Chinese food culture to the world, and make the world fall in love with Chinese rice noodles.

After more than ten years of hard work, Wumingyuan has formed its core advantages integrating product research and development, brand operations, and supply chain.

                <br><br> Our success can be attributed to our affordable yet authentic Chinese Noodles. The noodles are handmade with rice grains picked specifically in the summer, which give the rice noodles its soft springy texture. It is then boiled with broth containing 20 different types of precious herbs together with aged meat, <br> giving the soup it's tangy, spicy flavour.</p>
